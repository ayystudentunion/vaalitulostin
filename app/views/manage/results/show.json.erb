<%# Hack.. Wasn't able to render a view without a controller.
  #
  # Same kind of rendering, which is used with result.html, did not work.
  # Tried using 'av.extend JSONBuilder' etc, but did not get it working.
  # I did not want to include view data in a decorator and wanted to have
  # the same json template available to controllers, so manually running
  # JSONBUilder from an ERB template was the "cleanest" solution I came up with.
